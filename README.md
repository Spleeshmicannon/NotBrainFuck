# NotBrainFuck
My own version of BrainFuck. It adds 8 new symbols. These are all to make the language easier to use for beginners. Hence coining the name NotBrainFuck, since it goes against many of the original languages principals. I'm a first year CS major so I am happy to accept and learn from any criticisms.
